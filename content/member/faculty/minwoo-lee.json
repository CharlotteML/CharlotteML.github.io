  "introduction": "Jake is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the Charlotte. He is working on efficient agent's learning and adaptation encompassing transfer learning, interpretational learning, human-AI interactions, robust and safe exploration, and distributed learning. He received Ph.D. in Computer Science at the Colorado State University under the supervision of Chuck Anderson. His dissertation investigated and developed Sparse Bayesian Models to enable example-based reinforcement learning. His research has been supported by NSF and NIH.",
