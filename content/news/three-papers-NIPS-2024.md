# Three papers from CharMLab researchers accepted at NeurIPS 2024

The 38th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024), a premier annual gathering that draws together researchers and practitioners in machine learning, computational neuroscience, and related fields, will take place from December 10-15, 2024 at the Vancouver Convention Centre in Vancouver, Canada. Shedding light on new optimization methods, more efficient vision algorithms and new architectures for time series analysis, CharMLab researchers will present exciting new findings of our lab with three papers presented during the poster presentations.
