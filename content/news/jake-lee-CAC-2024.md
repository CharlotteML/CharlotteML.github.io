# Dr. Lee to serve as judge at 2024 Congressional App Challenge

Dr. Jake Lee has been selected to serve as a judge for the 2024 Congressional App Challenge. The Congressional App Challenge is a public effort to encourage kids to learn how to code, through annual district-wide competitions hosted by Members of Congress for their district. Students in participating districts code original applications for the chance to be selected for recognition by their Member of Congress, win prizes, and have their work put on display in the Capitol Building in Washington, DC.
