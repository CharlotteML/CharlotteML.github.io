# Twelve CharMLab papers presented at A\* conferences in 2024

We are looking back at a successful first entire calendar year since the inception of the CharMLab. With a record growth in research students engaged in research with us, we have been able to publish 12 papers at leading computer science conferences (A\* category), and communicated various recent research activities at conference workshops, as well as through journal papers and preprints.

Congratulations to all great students who made this possible, including to many of you with your first publication!
